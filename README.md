# Sunset Sunrise

Saw an Upwork job posted about creating a website that allows you to accurately view the sunrise and sunset times for any location.

## Description

Allows you to view multiple different times such as sunrise, sunset, first light, last light, dawn, dusk, solar noon, golden hour, day length, and the timezone.
